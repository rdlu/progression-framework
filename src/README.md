This is a static site that displays the progression frameworks that Qconcursos.com use internally for our staff 🙌

It's built in Gatsby, and deployed using Netlify.

## 🚀 Quick start

You'll need the Gatsby CLI on your machine, so if you don't have it, install it!
``` sh
yarn global add gatsby-cli
```

Next, navigate to the `progression-framework` directory and use yarn to get everything installed

``` sh
cd progression-framework
yarn
```

If you're developing locally, you can start up the site locally with hot loading ⚡
``` sh
gatsby develop
```

Finally, you can build everything into a set of static files 🛠️
``` sh
gatsby build
```
